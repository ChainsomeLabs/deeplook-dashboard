## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Run API

Run your own Deeplook backend, which exposes endpoints used by the dashboard. Add the API URL into `.env` file:

```bash
VITE_API_URL=https://your.deeplook.api.url
```

### 2. Install dependencies

We are using `pnpm` as a dependency manager, but feel free to use `npm`, `yarn` or any other.

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Run in development mode

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

### 4. Build for production

API URL is hardcoded into the production build at build time, make sure you use correct URL when building!

```bash
pnpm run build
```
